1.      It is proposed to use water   instead of   refrigerant   R-134a   as   the working   fluid   in   air-conditioning applications where the minimum temperature never falls   below   the freezing point. Would you support this proposal?   Explain.
2.    A refrigerator uses   refrigerant   R-134a as   the working   fluid   and   operates   on   an   ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle between 0.12   and   0.7   MPa. The mass flow   rate of the refrigerant is 0.05 kg/s.   Show   the   cycle   on   a   T-s   diagram   with respect to saturation   lines.   Determine: 
a.    The   rate of heat   removal from   the   refrigerated   space
b.    The   power   input   to   the   compressor
c.      The rate of heat   rejection to the   environment
d.      The coefficient of performance
3.      Consider a refrigeration system using refrigerant   R-134a   as the working   fluid.   If   this refrigerator is to operate in an   environment   at   30oC, what   is   the   minimum pressure to which the refrigerant should be compressed?   Why?4.      Refrigerant   R-134a enters the confenser of a residential heat   pump   at   800   kPa   and 55oC at a rate of 0.018   kg/s and   leaves   at   750   kPa   subcooled   by   3oC.   The   refrigerant enters the compressor at 200 kPa superheated   by 4oC.   Determine:
a.    The   isentropic efficiency   of the compressor
b.    The   rate   of代 写MAE 115 APPLIED ENGINEERING THERMODYNAMICS Hw#6R

c.      The COP of the   heat   pump
d.    The COP of the heat   pump   if   replaced with   an   ideal   vapor-compression   system operating between 200 and   800   kPa.
e.    The rate of heat   supplied   to   the   room for the   ideal   vapor-compression   system operating between 200 and   800   kPa.
5.    A regenerative gas   refrigeration system   using   air as   the working   fluid   has   a
pressure ratio of 5. Air enters the compressor at 0oC. The   high   pressure air   is   cooled to 35oC by rejecting heat   to   the   surroundings.   The   refrigerant   leaves   the   turbine at -80oC and then it absorbs   heat from the   refrigerated space   before entering the regenerator. The mass flow rate   of the air   is   0.4   kg/s. Assuming isentropic efficiencies of 80% for the compressor and 85% for the   turbine and   using constant specific heats at room temperature,   determine: 
a.    The   effectiveness   of the   regenerator
b.    The   rate of heat   removal from   the   refrigerated   space
c.      The COP of the   cycle
d.    The   refrigeration   load and the COP   if this system   operated   on the   simple   gas refrigeration cycle. Use the same   compressor   inlet temperature   as given, the same turbine inlet temperature as calculated, and the   same   compressor and turbine efficiencies.
